## Folder Structure
- `_features`: contains all the components separated based on the feature that they provide.
- `_features\ui`: contains the reusable UI components like buttons.
- `_lib`: contains reusable set of functions like datafetching functions.

Here, `_<folder>` means the folder is a private route i.e. it is non-routable.

### Routing
- A route group has been made to have separate layout for zen mode and other pages.
